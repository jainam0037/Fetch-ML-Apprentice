## Task 1: Sentence Transformer Implementation

Implemented a sentence transformer model using the `transformers` library. This model encodes input sentences into fixed-length embeddings.

### Key Steps:

1. Loaded the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer.
2. Created a custom class `SentenceTransformer` to generate embeddings.
3. Tested the model with sample sentences to ensure proper embeddings.

## Task 2: Multi-Task Learning Expansion

Expanded the sentence transformer model to handle multi-task learning with the following tasks:
- Task A: Sentence Classification
- Task B: Sentiment Analysis

### Key Steps:

1. Added task-specific heads to the model.
2. Created a custom class `MultiTaskModel` to support multi-task learning.
3. Modified the forward method to handle different tasks.

## Task 3: Training Considerations

Discussed various training scenarios:
1. Freezing the entire network.
2. Freezing only the transformer backbone.
3. Freezing one of the task-specific heads.

### Key Insights:

- Explained the implications and advantages of each scenario.
- Provided recommendations for transfer learning, including the choice of pre-trained models and layer freezing strategies.

## Task 4: Layer-wise Learning Rate Implementation (BONUS)

Implemented layer-wise learning rates for the multi-task sentence transformer.

### Key Steps:

1. Defined layer-wise learning rates for different layers.
2. Modified the optimizer to use layer-wise learning rates.
3. Implemented the training loop with layer-wise learning rates.

### Benefits:

- Allows better fine-tuning and prevents overfitting.
- Optimizes training by focusing learning where needed.
