## Task 1: Sentence Transformer Implementation

Implemented a sentence transformer model using the `transformers` library. This model encodes input sentences into fixed-length embeddings.

### Key Steps:

1. Loaded the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer.
2. Created a custom class `SentenceTransformer` to generate embeddings.
3. Tested the model with sample sentences to ensure proper embeddings.

## Task 2: Multi-Task Learning Expansion

Expanded the sentence transformer model to handle multi-task learning with the following tasks:
- Task A: Sentence Classification
- Task B: Sentiment Analysis

### Key Steps:

1. Added task-specific heads to the model.
2. Created a custom class `MultiTaskModel` to support multi-task learning.
3. Modified the forward method to handle different tasks.

## Task 3: Training Considerations

Discussed various training scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Entire Network is Frozen
**Implications and Advantages:**

- **Implications:** Freezing the entire network means that none of the model parameters are updated during training. This scenario effectively turns the transformer into a feature extractor, where the model generates embeddings based on pre-trained weights, and these embeddings are used as-is for downstream tasks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Efficiency: Training is faster because backpropagation is not required.
  - Stability: No risk of catastrophic forgetting, as pre-trained weights remain unchanged.

**Rationale:**

This scenario is useful when the pre-trained model already performs very well on the tasks, and the primary goal is to quickly validate or deploy a model without additional computational cost.

### Scenario 2: Only the Transformer Backbone is Frozen
**Implications and Advantages:**

- **Implications:** Freezing the transformer backbone while allowing the task-specific heads to be trained means that the model leverages the general language representations learned by the transformer while fine-tuning the heads for specific tasks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Leveraging Pre-trained Knowledge: The model can utilize the strong language representations from the transformer, which are often sufficient for many tasks.
  - Reduced Training Time: Training only the heads is faster than training the entire model.

**Rationale:**

This approach is beneficial when the transformer model's general representations are deemed sufficient, and only task-specific adjustments are necessary. It strikes a balance between leveraging pre-trained knowledge and adapting to specific tasks.

### Scenario 3: Only One Task-Specific Head is Frozen
**Implications and Advantages:**

- **Implications:** Freezing one of the task-specific heads means that the corresponding task does not get updated during training, while the rest of the model, including the other task-specific head, can be fine-tuned.
- **Advantages:**
  - Focused Training: Allows the model to focus on improving performance for the task with the unfrozen head.
  - Preserving Performance: Retains the performance of the frozen task, useful if that task already has satisfactory performance.

**Rationale:**

This approach is useful when one task is already well-optimized, and the goal is to improve performance on the other task without risking degradation of the well-optimized task.

### Transfer Learning Scenario
**Approach to Transfer Learning:**

- **Choice of Pre-Trained Model:** Use a robust and widely-used model such as BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT-3, depending on the task requirements and computational resources available. For this example, we'll use BERT.

**Layers to Freeze/Unfreeze:**

- Initially freeze the entire transformer backbone and only train the task-specific heads. This allows the task-specific layers to adapt to the new tasks using the general language representations from the pre-trained model.
- Gradually unfreeze lower layers of the transformer in subsequent training stages if further fine-tuning is required.

**Rationale:**

- **Initial Freezing:** By initially freezing the transformer backbone, we ensure that the model benefits from the pre-trained language representations without risking overfitting, especially when the training data is limited.
- **Gradual Unfreezing:** Gradually unfreezing lower layers allows for more fine-tuning and adaptation to the specific tasks, improving performance while maintaining the stability of the pre-trained weights.

## Task 4: Layer-wise Learning Rate Implementation (BONUS)

Implemented layer-wise learning rates for the multi-task sentence transformer.

### Key Steps:

1. Defined layer-wise learning rates for different layers.
2. Modified the optimizer to use layer-wise learning rates.
3. Implemented the training loop with layer-wise learning rates.

### Benefits:

- **Better Fine-Tuning:** Allows more fine-tuned adjustments to the model, improving performance by adapting different parts of the network at appropriate rates.
- **Prevent Overfitting:** Helps prevent overfitting in lower layers while allowing higher layers to adapt more readily to task-specific nuances.
- **Efficiency:** Optimizes the training process by focusing learning where it's most needed, leading to potentially faster convergence and better overall performance.
- **Multi-Task Setting:** In a multi-task setting, layer-wise learning rates ensure that the shared layers (transformer backbone) adapt properly while the task-specific heads receive enough focus to learn the distinct tasks effectively.

### Rationale for Layer-wise Learning Rates:

- **Lower Layers (0-3):** Lower learning rates (1x base) to prevent overfitting. These layers capture general linguistic features that are broadly applicable and should remain stable.
- **Middle Layers (4-7):** Slightly higher learning rates (2x base) as these layers start to capture more task-specific information that may need more fine-tuning.
- **Upper Layers (8-11):** Higher learning rates (3x base) as these layers capture the most task-specific features and benefit from more adaptation to the new tasks.
- **Task-specific Heads:** Highest learning rates (5x base) because these layers are entirely new and need significant tuning to learn the task-specific mappings.
